The OpenAPI Specification (OAS), formerly known as the Swagger Specification, is a standard format for describing REST APIs. It allows developers to design, document, and consume APIs in a language-agnostic way. OpenAPI specifications are written in JSON or YAML and can be used to generate API documentation, client and server stubs, and test cases. 


- Standardized way to define the structure and behaviour of any HTTP API.
- It is not tied to any programming language make it versatile for various API implementations
- Machine readable  - easily parsed by computers. facilitate automation and code generation.
- human readable - easily designed to be understand by humans.

Benefits of Open API:

improved documentation
reduced development time
easier api consumption
testing and automation

Simply your API lifecyle   design, develop and deploy faster  - built on Swagger

REST API is a style of web service architecuture, Open API is a specifiction for describing and 
documenting the REST API. They are complementary tools, not alternatives.
