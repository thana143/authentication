OpenID Connect enables an Internet identity ecosystem through easy integration and support, security and privacy-preserving configuration, interoperability, wide support of clients and devices, and enabling any entity to be an OpenID Provider (OP).
The OpenID Connect protocol, in abstract, follows these steps:

End user navigates to a website or web application via a browser.
End user clicks sign-in and types their username and password.
The RP (Client) sends a request to the OpenID Provider (OP).
The OP authenticates the User and obtains authorization.
The OP responds with an Identity Token and usually an Access Token.
The RP can send a request with the Access Token to the User device.
The UserInfo Endpoint returns Claims about the End-User.
